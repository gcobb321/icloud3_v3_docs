### Installation Notes

The following Installation Notes are not part of the actual installation process but may be useful.

### Restart Home Assistant (if necessary)

If something does not work, errors or alerts are displayed or iCloud3 does not begin tracking devices, restart Home Assistant may solve the problem.

When iCloud3 starts, it follows a startup process to:

- Check the directory settings
- Load the configuration parameters
- Load the tracked and monitored devices
- Access the your iCloud account to get the devices tied to your account
- Get the information for the devices using the HA Mobile App
- Tie everything together
- Start tracking. 

The results of this process are shown in the Event Log and detailed in *Event Log During Startup* in a previous chapter. 

- Check the Event Log (it should display something) for error messages.
- Check the HA Log file (*config/home-assistant.log*)
- Verify that the device_tracker and sensor entities are set up. The *Devices & Settings > Integrations > iCloud3* entry should show at least one device_tracker and some entities for that device.

### Clearing the Browser's Cache

When the a new version of the *Event Log card* is installed, it is not automatically loaded by your browser or the Mobile App. The browser's cache needs to be cleared.

#### Clear the Browser's Cache (Chrome, Edge, Safari, MacOS) {docsify-ignore}

The browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari) stores the Home Assistant screens in it's cache. This needs to be cleared to load the new version of the Event Log card.

1. Press **Ctrl-Shift-Delete**.
2. Select **Cached Images and Files**, the select **Clear Data**
3. Return to the Lovelace screen and click the **Refresh Icon**. 

Note: This process may be different for MacOS.



#### Clear the Home Assistant Mobile (Mobile App) Cache  {docsify-ignore}

The cache needs to be cleared when a new version of the Event Log is installed. A message, with instructions, is displayed when this is needed. It will need to be cleared on every device (iPhones, iPads) that is using the Mobile App. 

1. In the *Home Assistant Mobile App*, tap **☰ > HA Settings > Mobile App.**
2. Tap **Debugging > Reset front end cache**
3. Tap **Settings > Done**
4. Redisplay one of the Lovelace screens and pull it down to reload the screens.

### iCloud3 Log File

iCloud3 writes logging records to the */config/icloud3-0.log* file based on the Log Level configuration setting. This includes:

- **Info** - Informative messages that display tracking results and some messages on it's operations,
- **Debug** - Debug messages that provide a lot more information on the data received from the Mobile App and the iCloud account, it's operational status, error messages and other records on how the devices are being tracked,
- **Rawdata** - Rawdata messages log the actual records sent to and received from the iCloud account, actual data received from the Mobile App, how zones, devices and sensors are set up and event activity during when iCloud3 is starting. The data received from Apple Location Services is filtered to remove any fields that are not used by iCloud3.
- **Unfiltered** - Displays the same rawdata described above without any filters. Every data field received from Apple Location Servers is displayed.

> The Log Level configuration setting is on the *Configure Settings > Page 2 > Format Parameters* screen. Some can also be selected on the *Event Log > Actions* list.

*Notes*: 
- All records are written to the *icloud3-0.log* file. A new file is created if the Log Level is Debug.
- The log file is closed at midnight and renamed *icloud3-1.log*. A new file is created for the new day.
- Log Level Debug and Rawdata have an  Auto-Reset option that will reset the Log Level to Info at midnight.
