## iCloud3 Components   <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

There are 3 major parts to the iCloud3 custom component that are used to configure, track and report device location information. They are:

- **iCloud3 Device Tracker** - This monitors the device's location, determines when the device should be located next and updates all the sensors
- **Event Log** - Shows a devices location, how the location changes, the results of location updates, errors, and startup information
- **Configure Settings** - Set up all the iCloud3 tracked devices, Apple Accounts, sensors and other parameters

This section describes each of these items.

### iCloud3 Device Tracker

The iCloud3 Custom Component provides the core device tracking service. It does the following:
  - Initializes and sets up all tracking activities for the Devices using location data from iCloud Location Services or the Mobile App device_tracker entity (or both).

  - Monitors the Mobile App device_tracker entity for location changes, zone enter/exit triggers and battery information.

  - Requests and processes location data from iCloud Location Services and the Mobile App.

  - Analyzes the location data and tracks the devices.

  - Updates the sensors associated with each device.

    


The screens below show examples of a tracked device's current status. The following is displayed:

- Gary, on the left, is at Home. Lillian, on the Right is Away.
  - Arrive item - The icons and text show Gary is at Home (Home icon in a circle and he arrived home at @3:22p. Lillian is traveling towards home. Notice the distance, travel time and travel direction from the Home Zone. 
- Notice when the device was last located by iCloud or the Mobile App, when it was last updated by iCloud3 and the time of the next update. 
- Gary is tracking from Home and the Quail Zone, Lillian just from Home.
- The *Info* field shows tracking results from nearby devices is being used.

### Event Log

The Event Log is a Lovelace custom card that shows past and current activity related to tracking a device. This includes:

- Startup configuration.
- Device information for Apple account and Mobile App devices and entities
- Tracking results including zone, travel time and distance data
- Error messages, problems and location data issues
- Detail tracking monitors that show what is going on under the covers, how location data from the iCloud Location Services and the Mobile App is analyzed and processed

#### Actions command

The *Actions* command on the Event Log is used to control iCloud3 operations. This includes:
- Restart iCloud3 without restarting Home Assistant
- Pause and resume tracking
- Relocate all devices or a specific device
- Issue a *Find My Device* alert
- Export the Event Log to a text file
- Show/hide tracking monitors
- Set the Log Level (info, debug, rawdata) indicating the type of data to write to the *icloud3.log* file
- Run Waze History Database maintenance functions

Note: The Event Log is installed into the *config/www/icloud3* directory. This directory can be changed on the *Configure > Parameters Menu > Field Formats and Event Log Overrides* screen but there is really no need to do that.
