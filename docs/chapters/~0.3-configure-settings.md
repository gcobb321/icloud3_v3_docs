## Opening the Configure Settings screens

*The Configure Settings* screens are used to configure iCloud3 parameters and are opened from:

- The *Configuration Icon*  on the **Event Log screen**.
- **â˜° > HA Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations** screen or from the Gear icon on the Event Log screen.

The *Configure Settings* consists of 2 menus and 10+ parameter entry screens. Each screen has two parts:

- **Selection or parameter entry (top part)** - This is used to select a task to be done, an item to be selected or an option list/text field for the parameter being configured.
- **Command or Action to be done (bottom part)** - First select the desired option (Select/Next/Add/Update/Delete/etc.), then select the command in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen (Next/Submit/Finish/etc.).

The example screens below show these 2-sections. These and the other screens are described in detail in the *Configuring iCloud3 Parameters* chapter.
