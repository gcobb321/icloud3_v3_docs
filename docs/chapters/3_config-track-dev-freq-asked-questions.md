+ App Specific Passwords +

App Specific Passwords are not supported by iCloud3. iCloud3 is a program running on a computer, not an app running on an iDevice. It uses web service calls to request the location of the devices in the iCloud's Family Sharing List. Apps running on iDevices use a different access method that is not available by programs. This is discussed further in the _Apple Accounts_ section.
