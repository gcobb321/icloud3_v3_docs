# Frequently Asked Questions {docsify-ignore}


+ App Specific Passwords +

App Specific Passwords are not supported by iCloud3. iCloud3 is a program running on a computer, not an app running on an iDevice. It uses web service calls to request the location of the devices in the iCloud's Family Sharing List. Apps running on iDevices use a different access method that is not available by programs. This is discussed further in the _Apple Accounts_ section.



+ Occasionally, My iPhone does not exit the Home Zone when I leave +

This question is discussed in *Trouble Shooting > Tracking Issues* section.



+ Can I use a Hardware Security Key instead of my iCloud account password +

Not at the present time but it is under development. See the *Apple Accounts*  section for more information.



+ How can I display a map of where my iDevices have been +

HA provides a Lovelace map card that will show the location track of your iDevices. Refer to the HA Map documentation on setting it up. Add each Person (_person.gary_) or iDevice (<em>devicetracker.gary_iphone</em>)  you want to track on the Map configuration screen in the Entity field.
